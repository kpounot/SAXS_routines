SAXS analysis routines
======================
The package contains Python-based analysis routines for small-angle X-ray

The routines are initially intended to be used with SAXS data, where a liquid
chromatography column was connected before the injection into the capillary,
but can be used with standard measurement data as well.

Simply use ``python3 setup.py install``.
